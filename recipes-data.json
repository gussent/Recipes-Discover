Add about 1 TBS +/- of Jack cheese (or provolone, gouda, havarti, mozzarella). Add some sliced/chopped onion. I had some green onion from the garden and use the white tip only. But, you can easily add regular onion. Place a tomato slice on top. Add a pinch of Italian seasoning. Season with salt and pepper, if you like. If you are going to add feta cheese later, you might not need to add any salt. Bake in a preheated 425 oven for about 10-12 minutes. Please check them... you want them golden brown and nicely puffed. Depending on the puff pastry size, the cooking time will vary. Mine took 12 minutes. Sprinkle feta on top if you like.",
